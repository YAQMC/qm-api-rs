Source: <https://github.com/gongjiehong/QMCDecode>
Revision: `aea76301a08678100ec677cb61a8458bc75662ec`

| Upstream file / range | `qm-api-rs` target | Transformation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `QMCDecode/QMCipher.swift` `QMMapCipher.getMask` / `rotate` | `src/qmc.rs` `Qmc2Map::decrypt_in_place` | Independent Rust rewrite of the non-circular `(key << rot) \| (key >> rot)` mask. The key is indexed with `key.len()` rather than `& 0xFF`. |
| `QMCDecode/QMCipher.swift` `QMRC4Cipher` | `src/qmc.rs` `Qmc2Rc4` | Independent Rust rewrite of the 128-byte first segment and 5,120-byte segmented RC4 stream. |
| `QMCDecode/QMCKeyDecoder.swift` and `QMCDecode/TeaCipher.swift` | `src/qmc.rs` `derive_key`, `simple_make_key`, `decrypt_tencent_tea` | Independent Rust rewrite of ekey TEA unwrapping after any EncV2 outer wrapper is removed. |
